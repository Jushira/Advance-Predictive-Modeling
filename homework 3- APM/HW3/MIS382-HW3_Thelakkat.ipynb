Your class should take as input the learning_rate, regularization_constant and number of epochs.

Plot MSE and the $w$ parameters as a function of epoch count (10 epochs) for the best 2 combinations of learning_rate and regularization for both SGD and Adagrad. ie you should have 2 plots of MSE and parameter updates for SGD and adagrad each.

    "Adagrad (http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) differs from vanilla SGD in that the learning rate of each weight changes over updates. A cache is maintained that holds the sum of squares of all gradients upto the current update. The learning_rate is divided by the cache, resulting in a different learning rate for each weight. A consequence of this update rule is that weights that have already seen large gradients (made large jumps) make smaller updates in subsequent iterations.\n",

The description of the dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Tissue). Using the class tree.DecisionTreeClassifier (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.tree), build two different trees with a maximum depth of two using the split criteria (i) Gini and (ii) Entropy. Use all the data to build trees. Plot the two trees.
